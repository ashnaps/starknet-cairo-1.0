-Cairo is a programming language mainly used by L2 blockchain such as starknet.
-Cairo is derived from rust.
-In blockchain solutions every single interaction between a user and a d-app is verified by all the participants, which is Compute-intensive.
-Instead of having all the participants of the network to verify all user interactions, only one node, called the prover, execute the programs and generate proofs that the computations were done correctly.
-These proofs are then verified by an Ethereum smart contracts.
-This approach allows increased throughput and reduced transaction costs at the same time preserving Ethereum security.

->Things I learnt:
How to read Cairo 1 code
How to read Starknet smart contracts
How to interact with Starknet smart contracts using a browser wallet(ArgentX) and a block explorer(Starkcsan).

Its a fun learning experience. Feel free to reach out to me regarding the excersises.
